Revision history for Geo-TCX

1.06 [2022-12-14]
    Use UTC as the default time zone if the local time zone cannot be determined
        - the local time zone is determined by DateTime::TimeZone->new()
        - on some systems/platforms (e.g. FreeBSD), this method is unable to determine the local time zone
        - the default time zone only affects user's direct calls to Geo::TCX::Trackpoint's time_local() method
        - all date and time calculations are already made in UTC time, so module behaviour remains the same

1.05 [2022-12-07]
    Fixed bugs in the parsing of paths on MSWin32

1.04 [2022-12-03]
    Removed Geo::Calc from dependencies

1.03 [2022-11-24]
    Added support for FIT files by converting them to TCX files before parsing
        - FIT is Garmin's Flexible and Interoperable Data Transfer (FIT) protocol

    New Interactive.pm and tcx_interactive.pl class and script
        - Geo/TCX/Interactive.pm is a sub-class of Geo::TCX with methods that prompt the user
        - it is mainly used by tcx_interactive.pl to parse files interactively from the command-line
        - see 'man tcx_interactive.pl' and 'man Geo::TCX::Interactive'

    Ignore Extensions tags in Trackpoints (may be supported later if a need is identified)

1.02 [2022-10-27]

    Require version 1.44 of DateTime for the stringify() method

1.01 [2022-10-13]
    Changed time- and distance-related methods in Geo::TCX::Trackpoint
        - new Time() and time_datetime() accessors

=head1 NAME

tcx_interactive.pl - Script to use the L<Geo::TCX> module interactively from the command line or in the perl debugger

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  tcx_interactive.pl --help
  tcx_interactive.pl --src_dir=dir [ --help --recent=# --wrk_dir=dir --wpt_dir=dir --dev_dir=dir --distance_min=# --distance_max=# ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<tcx_interactive.pl> is a utility script that is mostly useful after having saved an activity from a GPS training device onto a computer.

The script looks up recently saved TCX or FIT files in the path specified by C<--src_dir> and prompts the user for one to parse. It reads the selected file, intiates a L<Geo::TCX::Interactive> instance, and prompts the user for commonly used methods such as C<save_laps()> among other.

The user is subsequently prompted whether they wish to read recently saved waypoints from their GPS device (provided it is currently plugged in via USB cable), save these points in a *.gpx waypoints file located in C<--wpt_dir>, and whether they wish to add the end points of each lap to that waypoints file.

The user can also transfer the resulting waypoints file back to their device for use during their next activity (not yet enabled, coming soon).

=head2 Options

=over 4

=item C<< --recent => # >>

specifies the number of recent files to look up in C<--src_dir>. The default is 25.

=item C<< --src_dir=I<$dir> >>

the directory where TCX or FIT files are located.

=item C<< --wrk_dir=I<$dir> >>

the directory where working files are to be saved, such as with the C<save_laps()> method.

=item C<< --wpt_dir=I<$dir> >>

If this option is specified, the script will attempt to load a waypoints file from the user's computer into the L<Geo::TCX::Interactive> instance. This option is used by a call to C<< gpx_load() >> which prompts the user to select a I<*.gpx> file from all such files found in I<$dir>.

The script will later prompt the user whether they wish to add other waypoints saved on the GPS device and also whether to add the begining and end position of each of the activity's laps parsed by the instance to the I<*.gpx> file.

=item C<< --dev_dir=I<$dir> >>

the directory on the GPS device where the waypoints are stored. On recent devices, this tends to be a C<Locations> folder and older devices it is sometimes named C<GPX/current>.

If C<< way_add_device() >> is called and I<$dir> is not specified, the method will search where this directory might be (provided the GPS device is plugged in).

=item C<< --distance_min => # >>

the distance (in meters) below which waypoints at the beginning or end of a lap are to be ignored when comparing with the waypoints file read in the instance. The default is 10 meters. This option avoids saving waypoints unecessarily as points that only differ by a negligible distance are in effect very likely to refer to the same location.

This option is only relevant for C<< way_add_endpoints() >>. It has no effect on C<< way_add_device() >> given that waypoints saved manually by a user on their device may contain other information such as a name and description, and therefore should probably not be overlooked.

This option will be renamed C<< --distance_min >> soon.

=item C<< --distance_max => # >>

the distance (in meters) above which waypoints stored on the device are to be ignored when comparing with the waypoints file read in the instance. The default is 50,000  meters (50km). This option can be useful when the device contains many waypoints that are very far from the bounds of the gpx instance (which avoids having the user answer 'no' to many prompts about points that are nowhere near the main geographic area of interest).

This option is only relevant for C<< way_add_device() >>.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This script is part of the L<Geo::TCX> module and relies on the L<Geo::TCX::Interactive> sub-class it provides.

L<Geo::FIT> is also required to parse FIT files and to add waypoints from a GPS device (except for some older models).

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Geo::TCX::Interactive>, L<Geo::Gpx>, L<Geo::FIT>.

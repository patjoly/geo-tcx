INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Alternatively, to install with Module::Build, you can use the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

    The Build.PL file is not maintained in the github repository. If you obtained the code from GitHub and would like to install with Module::Build, download the source tarball of the module from CPAN.org instead; it contains Build.PL (see https://metacpan.org/pod/Geo::TCX).
